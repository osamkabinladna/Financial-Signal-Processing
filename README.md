# Financial Signal Processing (Fall 2020)

Prof: Fred Fontaine

This course approaches financial engineering from a signal processing perspective. Stochastic processes: random walks, Brownian motion, Ito calculus, continuous models
including Black- Scholes, discrete models including negative binomial, martingales, stopping times. Representation and analysis of financial concepts such as price, risk,
volatility, futures, options, arbitrage, derivatives, portfolios and trading strategies. Analysis of single and multiple nonstationary time series, GARCH models.
Optimization methods, big data and machine learning in finance.
